* Compile file singly (should work!)
* Re-order includes (should work!)
* Traverse DAG deeper
* Try compiling again (should work!)
* For each remaining include:
  * Remove include. Try compiling. If it works, push that include to all children.
  * Replace include with components. Try compiling. If it works, push that include to all children.
  * Leave include.
* Done!
